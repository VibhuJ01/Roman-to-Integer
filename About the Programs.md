This program was made to, well as the name suggests, find the interger from the given roman number and vice versa.

In roman to integer, I just made a dictonary with value of all the letters in the roamn numerical language.
Then I added the sum in a variable as I a parsed through the string.

Integer to roman was a little tricky, I had to put lot of if-else statement to made a string accordingly.
If you well versed in programming you will understand what I am talking about.
